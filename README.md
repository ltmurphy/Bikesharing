# Bikesharing with NYC Citibike
An analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August 2019 using Tableau

## Overview
Story Link:

The purpose of this project was to examine and visualize bikesharing data from NYC Citibike in a way that would be helpful to potential business investors considering investing in the program at a different location, Des Moines, Iowa.
These visualizations will answer questions like:
- What is the user volume and type?
- Who is using these bikes and for how long?
- Where in the city are these rides concentrated?
- What are the hours for peak usage?

## Results
Des Moines, Iowa is certainly a far stretch from New York City but examining the numbers and how the business was effected in NYC will provide invaluable information for the planning and enacting of a similar business elswhere.

## Summary
As the story shows, a bikesharing program in an urban environment has the potential to be a steady and dependable source of income. Taking the lessons from NYC Citibike, a program in Des Moines could be effectively implemented to take advantage of the avenues of improvement presented in the visulizations. Advertising focused on the female user population could lead to a lasting increase in the userbase. Planning the distribution of access points to minimize the amount in low traffic areas could also be beneficial. It would also be prudent to examine the numbers for population and traffic comparing Des Moines and NYC to further solidify support for the project. Examining any possible local competition would also help. This data could be incorporated into the existing visualizations to provide information on how to increase revenue, the female userbase, and how to place access points, potentially using heatmap of city foot traffic.
